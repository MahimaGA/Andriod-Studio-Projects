#### Answer ####
> Under "res" we will add a folder named "values-es" for Spanish
> In "values-es" we have a file "strings.xml", we can provide Spanish texts for every string we have in our default string in another "string.xml" which is located in "values" folder
> 
> "adb shell am start -a android.settings.LOCALE_SETTINGS" run this command in terminal
> In the emulator, language settings will open, drag Spanish to the top
> The app will reload and you can view changes in the text
