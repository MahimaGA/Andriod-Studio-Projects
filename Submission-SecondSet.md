#### Question ####
> In the CupCake example, a NavHostController object is used. This allows the popBackStack method
> to be called. Which class does the NavHostController extend that contains the popBackStack() method? 
>  
> Which other method(s) in this parent class is/are used to move between the other screens in the Cupcake
> example? How are these used - please make reference to the code and not just the visual output?  


#### Answer ####
> In the Cupcake example, NavHostController inherits from NavController, which includes the popBackStack() method.
> 
> Another key method in this base class is navigate(), which is used to switch between screens in the Cupcake app.
> 
> The navigate() method requires a route parameter in the form of a String to identify the destination screen. Itâ€™s used in the code as follows:
> 
> navController.navigate(CupcakeScreen.Flavor.name)
> 
> This is used to navigate from Start to Flaour screen. similarly the function is also used to navigate to other screens.

#### Question ####
> *onCreate* is passed a parameter *(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)*. What is this? 
> What value will it have on first run. Please evidence this value with the use of the debugger and an appropriate screenshot.   
>
> What may cause this Bundle to change in DiceRoller?
>
> In your own implementation of DiceRoller, are you using this Bundle in anyway. 
> Please note that depending on how you have approached DiceRoller will determine the correct response to this section.
>  

#### Answer ####
> It is used to hold values you saved earlier in onSaveInstanceState
> 
> On first run it will have "null" value as shown in the screenshot below
> 
> ![diceroller](./image/diceqna.png)

> The changes in DiceRoller may be caused when we rotate our deviceor change in laguage or font size as shown in the screenshot below.
> 
> ![diceroller](./image/dicerollerqna2.png)
